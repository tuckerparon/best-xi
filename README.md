## About
Best.XI is a college soccer analytics tool that allows coaching staffs to make unbiased, data centric decisions in recruiting and lineup selection. The tool leverages data from existing data providers (Wyscout, Statsbomb, etc.) and allows coaches to determine what metrics matter for their system. This enriches the existing data with program-specific context to make more aligned decisions.
